                  Imagine a world where managing your finances is as simple and
                  instantaneous as sending a text message. With Backpack, that's
                  not a dreamâ€”it's reality. Just like you don't need a post
                  office to send a letter anymore, you don't need a traditional
                  bank to manage your money. You're in control, sending,
                  receiving, and investing your assets as effortlessly as you
                  send a text.
